# Color-Identifier

Utilizing an API to search and display colors by hex code

Live site here: https://ggriffey.github.io/Color-Identifier/

I created this project as a way to practice interfacing with an API. Utilizing the "Color API" (https://www.thecolorapi.com/), this minimalistic web app allows users to submit a hex code to the API, which is immediately checked for any potential errors (ie. the user enters an invalid hex code). The app will then use that data to dynamically change the information displayed on-screen, including the name and visual representation of that color.
